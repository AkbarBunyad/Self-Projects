1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I started by exploring the dataset, uncovering patterns, and gaining insights. Histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices helped me understand relationships between different features and the wine quality score.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Preprocessing the data was key to ensure accurate predictions. I handled missing values, removed outliers and dealt with imbalanced data.
